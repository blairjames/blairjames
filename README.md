ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blair :wolf:

:closed_lock_with_key: I'm passionate about application and network security, DevOps, and automation.

:snake: While Python has been a big part of my life and holds a place in my heart, I love creating with Go. It has the development flow and memory safety of Python, but brings with it all the intrinsic benefits of a strongly typed, highly opinionated, compiled language.

To me, interpreted languages have always felt natural for less mission-critical scripting and rapid development. In contrast, the compiled high-performance languages feel more professional and production-ready.

So the bulk of my development time in the last year or two has been using Go and, of course, the perennial Bash and all the magic (Dev|Sec|Git)Ops, IAC and CI tools that glue our services together accross the chain, like Terraform, which continues to impress me with how succinctly it can drive APIs hard.

I'm crazy about optimisation and continuous improvement, love building security tools and automating processes to improve situational awareness and proactively get in front of problems rather than constantly reacting and playing catch-up.

Based out of Sunny Brisbane Australia :australia:

I am always up for a collab or a discussion.
