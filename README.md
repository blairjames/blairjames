- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blair :wolf:
- :closed_lock_with_key: Iâ€™m passionate about application and network security as well as DevOps and all things automation.
- :snake: While Python holds a special place in my heart I love coding in Go, it is everything I always wished Python could be, right out of the box.
So the bulk of my development time in the last year or two has been using Go and of course the perennial Bash as well as all the magic (Dev|Sec|Git)Ops and CI frameworks that make our services sing. 
- I'm crazy about optimisation and continuous improvement.
- Love building security tools and automating processes to improve situational awareness for security and risk analysts. 
- Based out of Sunny Brisbane Australia :australia:
- I am always up for a collab or a discussion. 
- Hit me up at :mailbox: "blair@blairjames.com"
