ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blair :wolf:
:closed_lock_with_key: I'm passionate about application and network security, DevOps, and all things automation.
:snake: While Python holds a special place in my heart, I love coding in Go. It is everything I always wished Python could be right out of the box.
So the bulk of my development time in the last year or two has been using Go and, of course, the perennial Bash and all the magic (Dev|Sec|Git)Ops, IAC and CI tools that make our services sing, like Terraform, which continues to impress me with how succinctly it can drive APIs hard.
I'm crazy about optimisation and continuous improvement.
I love building security tools and automating processes to improve situational awareness so we can proactively get in front of problems.
Based out of Sunny Brisbane Australia :australia:
I am always up for a collab or a discussion.
